# **What is Git?**

**Git** is a console tool for tracking and maintaining a history of file changes in your project. Most often it is used for code, but it can be used for other files as well. For example, for pictures - useful for designers.

With **Git** - you can rollback your project to an older version, compare, analyze or merge your changes into a **repository**.

**Repository** refers to the repository of your code and the history of its changes. **Git** works locally and all your repositories are stored in specific folders on your hard drive.

Also, your repositories can be stored on the Internet. Usually three services are used for this:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)

Each savepoint in your project is named **commit**. Each **commit** has a **hash (unique id)** and a comment. From such **commit**-s a **branch** is built. **Branch** is the history of changes. Each branch has its own name. A repository can contain several branches that are created from or merged into other branches.
